# Simple text editor
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

## Initial setup
Run `npm install` in order to setup application

## Development server
Run `npm start` for a dev server.

## Notes
+ Text sample is given in `text.service.js`
+ Given files structure is not obligatory and could be changed

+ This is the my progress timeboxed in 2 hours
+ You can select a word and apply styles using the buttons of Control Panel
+ I think i need one more hour to finish a minimum "Must have" requirements.

## Next Steps
+ Implement api call to change the word by synonyms (i was thinking to make create a function that make the api call in App.js and send the function as prop)
+ Change the styles application and use proper html tags (`<b>, <i>, <u>`)
+ Make visible what word is selected
